alchemy_api
===========

This is a library implementing the AlchemyAPI. It's built on top of [monster_mash](http://github.com/dbalatero/monster_mash), which means you can hit Alchemy with your choice of serial or parallel requests.

* Text extraction from text/html/URL

Currently the following APIs are not supported yet:

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
